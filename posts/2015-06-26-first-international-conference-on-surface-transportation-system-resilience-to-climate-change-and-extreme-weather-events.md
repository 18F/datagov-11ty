title: First International Conference on Surface Transportation System Resilience
  to Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events
---
**September 16-18, 2015**


**The National Academy of Sciences Building****Washington,Â DC**


The Transportation Research Board will host a conference September 16-18, 2015 to provide transportation professionals with information about emerging best practices and research results on how to adapt surface transportation networks to the potential impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. The conference will examine efforts to mainstream consideration of climate change and extreme weather resilience in all aspects of the transportation sector, including planning and programming, capital improvements, and operations and maintenance.
